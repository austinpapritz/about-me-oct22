            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Austin. I was born in San Antonio, Texas. I grew up in Salem, OR and
                graduated from Sprague High School in 2009. I studied Philosophy at BYU and later
                attended a semester of medical school on the island of Nevis in the Caribbean. After
                several years of trying different career paths, I have finally decided to start web
                development at Alchemy Code Lab.

                My current interests include running, hiking, and mountain climbing. This past
                summer I summited Mt. Hood twice in three days. I also climbed Mt. Rainier and Mt.
                Jefferson twice.
